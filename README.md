# IRWA-2021-final-project-part-3

To execute the code you have to run all the cells in order. We have written the queries in part 2 and 3 so it is easier to execute them, that is to say, you do not need to write them. If you want to change the queries you just have to write the ones that you want in the part where them are written.

The third to last cell (number 54) take a long time to execute (~5 minutes). 
The results of all the queries search can be seen on the screen.
