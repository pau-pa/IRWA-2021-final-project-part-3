First you have to upload the dataset_tweets_WHO.txt to your environment. To run de code you have to execute all the cells, changing the docs_path if you have uploaded the dataset to another one.

We have inserted the queries in part 2 and 3 so it is easier to execute them, that is to say, you do not need to write them. If you want to change the queries you just have to write the ones that you want in the part where them are written.

The third to last cell (number 54) take a long time to execute (~5 minutes). 
The results of all the queries search can be seen on the screen.
